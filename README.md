## Learning JavaScript via [Learn JavaScript for Free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript?utm_source=scrimba&utm_medium=scrim&utm_campaign=learn_javascript_launch&utm_content=fcc)

The starter files for the challenges on [Scrimba source repo](https://github.com/scrimba/learn-javascript) were pre-filled so I chose to delete them and start fresh, and while the css and HTML content is not the focus of this course, I also decided to delete it so that I practice and more via repetition and get creative with it.
